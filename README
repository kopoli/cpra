Requirements:

- A very recent clang (tested with 2.9)


Compilation:

make

You might need to adjust the makefile to suit your needs. Some automated unit
testing program is automatically built. It can be run with the command:

make test
or
./cpra_test

To display the available options run the following:

./cpra -h


Example run:

./cpra -vr -- testcode.cc | grep m_value
 Int JepJep::Jotain::m_value linkage: global IsDef IsDecl at testcode.cc 12:7
 Int JepJep::Jotain::m_value linkage: global at testcode.cc 16:28
 Int JepJep::Jotain::m_value linkage: global at testcode.cc 34:5

This displays the full name of the variable m_value with the lines it is
defined and used.
